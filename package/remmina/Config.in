	  Remmina is a remote desktop client written in GTK+, aiming to be
	  useful for system administrators and travellers, who need to work
	  with lots of remote computers in front of either large monitors
	  or tiny netbooks.

	  Remmina supports multiple network protocols in an integrated and
	  consistent user interface.

	  Currently RDP, VNC, NX, XDMCP and SSH are supported.
