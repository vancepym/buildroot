cubieboard, cubieboard2 and cubietruck

-----
Intro
-----

To be able to use your cubieboard board with the images generated by
Buildroot you have to correctly setup the SD card.

For more information, please see http://linux-sunxi.org/FirstSteps

---------------
How to build it
---------------

You need to use the cubie*_defconfig, to do so:
cubieboard1 (a.k.a. cubieboard):
 * make cubieboard_defconfig

cubieboard2:
 * make cubieboard2_defconfig

cubieboard3 (a.k.a. cubietruck):
 * make cubietruck_defconfig

And to compile:
 * make

-----------------
What is generated
-----------------

After building, you should obtain this tree:

    output/images/
    +-- rootfs.tar
    +-- boot.scr
    +-- script.bin
    +-- u-boot.bin
    +-- u-boot-env.bin
    +-- u-boot-sunxi-with-spl.bin
    +-- uImage

--------------------------
How setting up the SD card
--------------------------

Depending on the rootfs size, you might want to use a 2GB or larger SD-card.
The script mkcubiecard.sh will take care of partitioning and formatting
the SD-card.

BEWARE! This process will erase your SD card.

Use dmesg to find out where the SD card is attached in the /dev tree
(<device>) and then:

# sudo ./mkcubiecard.sh <images_dir> <device>

where:
 - <images_dir> is the directory containing the generated files (usually
   output/images)
 - <device> is the device file of the SD card (usually /dev/mmcblk0 or /dev/sdX)


Alternately, you may set up the SD card only to boot from the network:

# sudo ./mkcubiecard.sh <images_dir> <device> [netboot]

where:
 - <images_dir> and <device> as above
 - [netboot] specify whether to boot from network (should yes, if you want)

ATTENTION: This operation will keep the partition table of your SD card, will not
           write any data to the existing partitions. However, if the first
           partition ahead of the 1MB offset, it will be damaged.
